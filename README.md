# psychophysiological-interaction (PPI)
bBain connectivity analysis method for functional brain imaging data, mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 
It estimates context-dependent changes in effective connectivity (coupling) between brain regions.
Thus, PPI analysis identifies brain regions whose activity depends on an interaction between psychological context (the task) 
and physiological state (the time course of brain activity) of the seed region.

1. extract VOI
2. createPPI variable
3. plot coordinates on standard anatomical brain image
